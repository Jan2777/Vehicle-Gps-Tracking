<h1>üöó Vehicle Recognition for GPS Tracking</h1>

Welcome to the Vehicle Recognition for GPS Tracking project developed by Xenovex Technologies! üåü This project leverages advanced computer vision techniques to classify vehicle types, recognize number plates, and seamlessly integrate with GPS tracking systems for efficient vehicle monitoring.

<h2>üì∏ Project Overview</h2>
This project aims to enhance vehicle tracking systems using:

Vehicle Type Classification: Identifying the type of vehicle (e.g., car, truck, motorcycle) using YOLOv8.
Number Plate Recognition: Extracting and reading vehicle number plates with EasyOCR.
GPS Integration: Tracking vehicle locations in real-time based on recognized number plates.

<h2>üöÄ Features</h2>
Vehicle Type Classification
Utilizes YOLOv8 to accurately classify different types of vehicles.
Provides real-time classification results to facilitate efficient tracking and management.
Number Plate Recognition
Employs EasyOCR to detect and recognize vehicle number plates.
Automatically updates tracking information based on recognized number plates.
GPS Tracking
Integrates with GPS systems to track vehicle locations.
Provides live tracking updates and historical location data.
